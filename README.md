### Hello there


### I'm Kadir Tayyip Erkan, senior computer engineering student @ Ankara University and a part time -FULL STACK- WEB developer @ TÜBİTAK. 

### Also I'm currently working on a deepfake detector, which is aimed to detect deepfakes using a CNN based deep learning model and report it. 
##### Fun fact: I hate Java and JavaScript like everyone else. (Reddit moment) I only love programming languages that starts with the letter C.
